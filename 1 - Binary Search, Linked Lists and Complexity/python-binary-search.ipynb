    "\n",
    "The best way to learn the material is to execute the code and experiment with it yourself. This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This notebook is made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.\n",

    "\n",
    "Whether you're pursuing a career in software development or data science, it's almost certain that you'll be asked to solve programming problems like *reversing a linked list* or *balancing a binary tree* in a technical interview or coding assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's well known, however, that you will almost never face these problems in your job as a software developer. So it's reasonable to wonder why such problems are asked in interviews and coding assessments. Solving programming problems demonstrates the following traits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can **think about a problem systematically** and solve it systematically step-by-step.\n",
    "2. You can **envision different inputs, outputs, and edge cases** for programs you write.\n",
    "3. You can **communicate your ideas clearly** to co-workers and incorporate their suggestions.\n",
    "4. Most importantly, you can **convert your thoughts and ideas into working code** that's also readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not your knowledge of specific data structures or algorithms that's tested in an interview, but your approach towards the problem. You may fail to solve the problem and still clear the interview or vice versa. In this course, you will learn the skills to both solve problems and clear interviews successfully.\n"

Writing is a great tool for thinking clearly. It's likely that you will find some parts of the solution difficult to express, which suggests that you are probably unable to think about it clearly. The more clearly you are able to express your thoughts, the easier it will be for you to turn into code."

Unless otherwise stated, the term _complexity_ always refers to the worst-case complexity (i.e. the highest possible time/space taken by the program/algorithm to process an input).\n",

    "\n",
    "2. The _space complexity_ is some constant `c'` (independent of `N`), since we just need a single variable `position` to iterate through the array, and it occupies a constant space in the computer's memory (RAM).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Big O Notation**: Worst-case complexity is often expressed using the Big O notation. In the Big O, we drop fixed constants and lower powers of variables to capture the trend of relationship between the size of the input and the complexity of the algorithm i.e. if the complexity of the algorithm is `cN^3 + dN^2 + eN + f`, in the Big O notation it is expressed as **O(N^3)**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.\n",
    "2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.\n",
    "3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.\n",
    "4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.\n",
    "5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.\n",
