You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n",

    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python.

    "We can now see that each `merge_sort` call itself invokes `merge_sort` twice (but with an array half the size), and also invokes the `merge` function once to merge the two resulting arrays. The two calls to `merge_sort` themselves make two recursive calls followed by an invocation of `merge`. The division continues till we reach an list of size 1 or 0. Thus, the merge sort algorithm ultimately boils down to a series of `merge` operations performed on arrays of varying sizes. Inside the `merge` function we perform comparisons and add numbers to a new array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** Verify that time complexity of the merge operation is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the sum of the sizes of the two input lists. Hint: Count the number of comparisons.\n",

    "![](https://i.imgur.com/j1IuS2t.png)\n",

    "Counting from the top and starting from 0, the $k^{th}$ level of the above tree involves $2^k$ invocations of `merge` with sublists of size roughly $n / 2^k$, where $n$ is the size of the original input list. Therefore the total number of comparisons at each level of the tree is $2^k * n/2^k = n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if the height of the tree is $h$, the total number of comparisons is $n*h$. Since there are $n$ sublists of size 1 at the lowest level, it follows that $2^{(h-1)} = n$ i.e. $h = \\log n + 1$. Thus the time complexity of the merge sort algorithms is $O(n \\log n)$.\n",
